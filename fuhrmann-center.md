# Euler Line, Nagel Line, Fuhrmann Center

Figure: https://www.geogebra.org/m/quuujwa3

Centroid $G$ divides both segments $\overline{OH}$ and $\overline{IX_8}$ in the same ratio $1:2$.

## Euler Line

The line through $X_{20}$, $O$, $G$, $X_5$, $H$ is Euler Line. The Green Line in the figure.

- $O$ is midpoint of $X_{20}$ and $H$.
- $X_5$ is midpoint of $O$ and $H$.
- $\overline{OG}:\overline{GH} = 1:2$.

## Nagel Line

The line through $I$, $G$, $X_{10}$, $X_8$ is Nagel Line. The Blue Line in the figure.

- $X_{10}$ is midpoint of $I$ and $X_8$.
- $\overline{IG}:\overline{GX_8} = 1:2$.

## Fuhrmann Center

The segment $`\overline{HX_8}`$ is the diameter of the Fuhrmann Circle. The Red Line in the figure.

- $\therefore$ Center of Fuhrmann Circle, $Fu(X_{355})$, is midpoint of $H$ and $X_8$.
