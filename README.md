## Some Properties of Conics

1. In parabola only,   
     - Mid points of any number of parallel chords are all collinear and lie on a line parallel to the axis.
     - Line joining the intersection of two tangents and the mid point of their chord-of-contact, is parallel to the axis.
     - Both have $`y`$ co-ordinate $`a(t+t')`$ where $`t`$ and $`t'`$ are parameters of the extremitites of any of the parallel chords of $`y^2 = 4ax`$
       with slope $`\frac{1}{t+t'}`$.
     - A circle with any focal chord as diameter, is tangent to the directrix.
3. In ellipse and hyperbola only,
     - Product of the lengths of the two $`\perp`$'s from foci on any tangent is $`b^2`$ where $`b`$ is the minor or conjugate axis of ellipse or hyperbola respectively.
5. Reflection property for all conics.
6. For all conics,
    - Tangent intercept between point of contact and directrix, subtends $`90^\circ`$ at the (corresponding) focus.

### Hyperbola

- Angle between asymptotes, $`\theta = 2sec^{-1}(e)`$, where $`e`$ is the eccentricity.

## Circumhyperbolas

- If the angle between asymptotes of IC(L) is $`\theta`$ and the angle of incidence of L on the circumcircle is $`i`$, then $`\theta + i = 90^\circ`$
