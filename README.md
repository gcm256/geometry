## Some Properties of Conics

1. In parabola only,   
     - Mid points of any number of parallel chords are all collinear and lie on a line parallel to the axis.
     - Line joining the intersection of two tangents and the mid point of their chord-of-contact, is parallel to the axis.
     - Both have $`y`$ co-ordinate $`a(t+t')`$ where $`t`$ and $`t'`$ are parameters of the extremities of any of the parallel chords of $`y^2 = 4ax`$
       with slope $`{1} \over {t+t'}`$.
     - A circle with any focal chord as diameter, is tangent to the directrix.
     - The intersection points of any three tangents to a parabola, are vertices of a triangle whose orthocenter belongs to the directrix of the parabola and the circumcircle of the triangle passes through the focus of the parabola.
     - The foot of the $`\perp`$ from the focus to any tangent, always lies on the tangent at vertex.
3. In ellipse and hyperbola only,
     - Product of the lengths of the two $`\perp`$'s from foci on any tangent is $`b^2`$ where $`b`$ is the length of the semi-minor or semi-conjugate axis of ellipse or hyperbola respectively.
5. Reflection property for all conics.
6. For all conics,
    - Tangent intercept between point of contact and directrix, subtends $`90^\circ`$ at the (corresponding) focus.

### Hyperbola

- Angle between asymptotes, $`\theta = 2sec^{-1}(e)`$, where $`e`$ is the eccentricity.

## Circumconics

Isogonal Conjugate (IC) of a straight line L, is a circumconic (and vice versa). We will denote the IC of L as IC(L).

- Iff L is line at infinity, IC(L) is the circumcircle.
- Iff L does not meet the circumcircle, IC(L) is a circumellipse.
- Iff L is tangent to the circumcircle, IC(L) is a circumparabola.
- Iff L cuts the circumcircle, IC(L) is a circumhyperbola.
   - Iff L passes through $`O`$, the circumcenter, ie L is a circumcircle diameter, then the IC(L) circumhyperbola is a rectangular hyperbola. Every rectangular circumhyperbola:
       - Is the IC of a circumcircle diamater L.
       - Passes through the orthocenter $`H`$ (Since $`O`$ and $`H`$ are isogonal conjugates (ICs)).
       - Has its center on the nine-point circle, where the two ($`\perp`$) Simson lines at the ends of the diameter L meet.

### Circumcircle

- The two Simson lines at the ends of any diameter to the circumcircle are $`\perp`$ to each other and meet on the nine-point circle.

### Circumhyperbolas

- If the angle between asymptotes of IC(L) is $`\theta`$ and the angle of incidence of L on the circumcircle is $`i`$, then $`\theta + i = 90^\circ`$.

### Using Trilinear

- IC of line $`f(x, y, z) = 0`$ is the circumconic $`f(\frac{1}{x}, \frac{1}{y}, \frac{1}{z})`$, and vice versa.
- Let line L be $`\tau_1x + \tau_2y + \tau_3z = 0`$. Then IC(L) is $`\frac{\tau_1}{x} + \frac{\tau_2}{y} + \frac{\tau_3}{z} = 0`$. L is called the Central Line of the point $`(\tau_1 : \tau_2 : \tau_3)`$.
- Center of IC(L) is $`\tau_1(-a\tau_1 + b\tau_2 + c\tau_3) : do : do`$.
- 4th Point of IC(L) is $`(a\tau_2 - b\tau_1)(a\tau_3 - c\tau_1) : do : do`$.
